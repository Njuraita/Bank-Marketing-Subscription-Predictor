Key Metrics and Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: The model should have an accuracy score of at least 80% best at >85%
2. **Precision and Recall**: Achieve at least 80% to ensure reliable churn prediction and identification.
3. **F1 Score**: Minimum of 0.75 to balance precision and recall, especially for imbalanced classes.
4. **AUC-ROC Score**: At least 0.85 to effectively distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.
5. **Confusion Matrix**: Lower the number of False Negatives (FN) to ensure most churn cases are identified.
